# Repostit
This is a proof of concept reddit clone that I made using typescipt and graphql by following several tutorials. 
I plan on expanding on the web app by adding more features such as:
- Comments
- Profiles
- Subpages (subreddits) 
- Home pages 

As well as updating the UI (currently using Chakra-UI).
