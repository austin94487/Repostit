When we run this command:
req.session.userId = user.id;

We are storing some data into session. So behind the scenes, any data stuck to this session object will-
be sent to redis:
{userId: 1} -> send that to redis 

Redis is a key-value storage, so it will look something like this
1)
sess:qewrhhrhuqwefri -> (maps to our object) {userId: 1} 

2)
The express-session middleware will set a cookie on the browser (which will look like: ufwiueuhif23h8329u423nir)
think of the cookie as a signed version of the session key

3) 
When user makes a request...
ufwiueuhif23h8329u423nir -> sent to the server

4) 
On the server, the cookie is unsigned|decrypt using the secret we have
ufwiueuhif23h8329u423nir -> sess:qewrhhrhuqwefri 

5) 
Make a request to redis by looking up the key
sess:qewrhhrhuqwefri -> { userId: 1 }

req.session = { userId: 1 }
